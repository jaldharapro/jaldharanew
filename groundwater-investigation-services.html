          <h2>GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATION SERVICES</h2>

          <p>Groundwater and underground strata survey with the help of various geophysical techniques
            such as resistivity survey, recharge test, aquifer pumping test, etc. is our other important
            offering.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-4">Most common purposes for which groundwater investigation services are required are:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>
              <b>Drilling of new bore wells or construction of dug wells for groundwater extraction</b> <br/>
              <p>Groundwater survey is used to scientifically estimate the most appropriate location, depth, yield
                and water quality of the aquifer. Accordingly design of groundwater extraction structure such as a
                bore well or a dug well is recommended. This helps prevent unnecessary expenditure incurred on
                random drilling which may not yield satisfactory results.</p>
            </li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>
              <b>Drilling of rainwater recharge bore wells</b> <br/>
              <p>Groundwater survey plays an important part in identifying aquifers with good recharge potential.
                Design of rainwater recharge bore well can accordingly be recommended so as to maximise the
                efficiency and life of recharge bore well.</p>

            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>
              <b>To determine possible solutions of artificial underground drainage of excess water in water-
                logged areas</b> <br/>
              <p>Groundwater survey is used to identify aquifers with good recharge potential in water logged
                areas. These aquifers can then be used to drain off excess water accumulating on surface in areas
                prone to water logging.</p>
