            <p>
              Comprehensive annual maintenance services, which include implementation as well as
              consultancy, are provided to ensure optimum results and long life of new and existing
              rainwater harvesting systems. Maintenance services are offered either as a standalone
              offer or as an Annual Maintenance Contract. Activities involved in maintenance are
              decided based on unique requirements of a rainwater harvesting system. If customer is
              capable of deploying his own labour and material then we can provide maintenance
              consultancy also.

            <p>Success of a rainwater harvesting system depends on its timely and proper maintenance. Like
              any other system, maintenance is an integral activity required to sustain, retain and improve
              the efficiency of a rainwater harvesting system. Ignoring this crucial aspect will lead to
              <b>inefficient recharge & storage, contamination of groundwater & stored rainwater,
              wastage of rainwater as overflow, leakage problems which may pose damage to
              building, flooding of the premises, irreversible problems in rainwater harvesting system
              itself and significant reduction in life expectancy of the system.</b> All these problems will
              make investment in rainwater harvesting null over a period of time and defeat the very
              purpose for which it has been implemented.</p>

              <h4 class="mt-5">Maintenance Frequency</h4>

              <p>Once a year in the months of <b><u>January to May</u></b><sup>*</sup> before onset of rainy season.</p>
            
              <p><sup>*</sup><b><i>This is the most suitable time period for maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems due
                to dry pits and no hindrance to work since there are no rains. We do not undertake
                maintenance work during rainy season (June to September).</i></b></p>
